What we have here is a weather dashboard for module 6 challenge.

When you enter in a location it will give you the next 5 day forcast for temp and humidity, along with the current forcast for Temperature, Humidity, and Windspeed.

This application was built using the api from OpenWeatherMap.org

This Application also utilizes Html, JaveScript, and Bootstrap 4

Below you can find screenshots of the application in process.
